"This dataset represents the Stock Price of Google incorporation between 2013-2018 years. The data is presented in CSV format as follows: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume,Adj Close.
I created a time series model using Facebook Prophet and predicted the closing stock prices for the next 100 days. Then I tuned the hyperparameters using  Bayesian Optimization. Additionally, at the end of project, I compared results of my forecast with default parameters and the parameters offered by Bayesian Optimization . 
It's worth mentioning that Bayesian Optimization offered approximately 30 options which can also be used for forecasting."
